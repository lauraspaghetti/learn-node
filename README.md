# Online Secondhand Shop

Welcome to the Online Secondhand Shop project! This application showcases a simple yet functional platform for buying and selling secondhand items. This project is based on a tutorial from OpenClassrooms, where I implemented the backend using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, while the frontend was provided by OpenClassrooms.

## Tutorial Link

You can follow along with the tutorial here: [OpenClassrooms Full-Stack Course](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/courses/6390246-passez-au-full-stack-avec-node-js-express-et-mongodb)

## Topics Covered

Throughout the course, I learned and implemented the following concepts:

- **Creating a Simple Web Server with Express**: Set up a basic server to handle requests and responses.
  
- **Building a REST API with Node, Express, and MongoDB**: Developed a RESTful API for managing products in the secondhand shop, including endpoints for CRUD operations.

- **Implementing Authentication in an Express Application**: Integrated a user authentication system to secure certain routes and operations.

- **Handling User Files in an Express Application**: Managed user-uploaded files effectively, allowing users to add images and other relevant documents to their product listings.

## Features

- User authentication (sign up, log in, and log out)
- API endpoints for products (create, read, update, delete)
- File upload functionality for product images
- User-friendly interface for managing items

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of the project up and running, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/learn-node.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd learn-node
   ```

3. **Install backend dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Install frontend dependencies (if applicable):**

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

5. **Set up environment variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the backend directory and add your database connection string and any other configuration variables needed for your application.

6. **Start the backend server:**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   nodemon server
   ```

7. **Start the frontend application:**

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```
Once the project is set up, please refer to part 4 of the interface, as it includes all the features listed above.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for data storage.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js, used for building the API.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
